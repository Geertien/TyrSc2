# Tyr
This repository contains the bot Tyr.

## Getting started
### Preperations
First you will have to install some things, if you haven't already.
1. Download [Starcraft 2](https://starcraft2.com/)
2. Install [Visual studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). In the installer, choose the .NET desktop development IDE.
3. Go [here](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#downloads) and download the Season 3 map pack.
4. Extract the maps to 'C:\Program Files (x86)\StarCraft II\Maps\'. Make sure you have extracted the maps directly into the folder, if they aren't in exactly the right place the program will be unable to find them.

### Running Tyr
To run Tyr, simply start Tyr.exe and it will start playing a game against itself.
If you want to run it against other bots, you will need to install the [ladder manager](https://github.com/Cryptyc/Sc2LadderServer#developer-install--compile-instructions-windows).
You should them put the entire contents of Tyr/bin/Debug into the bot folder for Tyr, and follow the instructions provided with the ladder manager to set up a game.
